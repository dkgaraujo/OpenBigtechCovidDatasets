# OpenBigtechCovidDatasets
## Description
[Open Bigtech Covid Datasets.R](https://github.com/dkgaraujo/OpenBigtechCovidDatasets/blob/master/Open%20Bigtech%20Covid%20Datasets.R) is an R code to retrieve open datasets related to Covid from Bigtechs, such as Google Mobility and Facebook Symptom Survey. The current version of the code simply download the data, highlighting how to query the datasets from the internet. It's intended purpose is to help policymakers, especially central banks, bank regulators and bank supervisors to more easily collect and analyse such data to help them formulate public policies.

Please note that all of these datasets are provided by the original sources on as "as-available" basis, and that they might also at any moment, and without prior notice, withhold such data from public distribution.

A second file, [containment measures.R](https://github.com/dkgaraujo/OpenBigtechCovidDatasets/blob/master/containment%20measures.R), downloads and plots a summary of containment measures from the [Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker)
